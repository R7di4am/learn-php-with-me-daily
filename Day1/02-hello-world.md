### 🚀 So Now Let's Write Our First PHP Code!

#### 🐧 Linux
+ Start Apache:
```bash
sudo service apache2 start
````

- Then go to:
    

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
```

- Create a file called `index.php` and add this:
    

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, world! 🌍";
?>
```

- Open your browser and go to:
    

```
http://localhost
```

---

#### 🪟 Windows (XAMPP)

- Open **XAMPP Control Panel** and click **Start** on Apache.
    
- Go to the XAMPP `htdocs` folder. Usually it's:
    

```
C:\xampp\htdocs
```

- Create a file called `index.php` in that folder and write this:
    

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, world! 🌍";
?>
```

- Open your browser and go to:
    

```
http://localhost
```

> 💡 Boom! You just ran your first PHP script on Windows too! 🎉
